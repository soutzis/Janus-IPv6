# Janus-IPv6

Janus is an implementation of a stateful, network-aware traffic normalizer (*aka an 'Active Warden'*) running in an SDN environment, 
developed as part of my Bachelors thesis, that researched the mitigation of covert channels found in IPv6. (The covert channels in
IPv6 were taken by existing literature and were not discovered nor documented by me).

This project touches only the aspect of storage covert channels and is by no means suitable for deployment in a **real** network.
